************************** IV. SOFTWARE OVERVIEW ****************************
*****************************************************************************

PlaceMarkÂ© is a simple iPhone app written in Objective-C that will allow users 
to mark places as small or smaller than a city to visit someday. They get to 
set both distance and time based alerts. Distance based alerts will alert them 
whenever they are within that distance of the place or after the set time. The 
application will need to continue running in the background, periodically 
checking distances. Because of this, multitasking is essential, so the app will 
need iPhone 4 or later and GPS to run. PlaceMark is released under the MIT open 
source license.

The app may run on iPod touch and iPad, but it has only been tested on the 
iPhone simulator in the iPhone SDK to date.
